avr-kernel
==========

A simple cooperative multi-tasking kernel for AVR microcontrollers.  Written for the ATmega328P (using an Arduino Uno) but should be adaptable to other AVR8 MCU's.  Configurable to allow up to 8 threads, with a custom stack size for each thread and optional canary values to detect stack overflow situations.
