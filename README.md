avr-kernel
==========

This repository consists of several tutorials detailing the creation of a simple multi-threaded kernel targetting AVR microcontrollers.  These tutorials were written specifically for the ATmega328P (using an Arduino Uno board), however they should be usable on other 8 bit AVR devices with minimal modification.

The master branch contains the full kernel along with a simple example usage.  The other branches contain the code for each tutorial.

See [the wiki](../../wiki) for the tutorials.
